** Introduction
*** What is NixOS ?
    [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] is a Linux Distribution based on top of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nix_package_manager][Nix]] package manager,
    a package manager inspired by the functional programming paradygm. In
    fact, with Nix & NixOS, your systems can be entirely crafted in a
    declarative manner from ~*.nix~ configuration files. Nix utilities
    take these files as input, and produce a system environment for your
    host as an output. Thus, if you deploy the same configuration files on
    two machines, they will behave exactly the same way. Same input
    configurations give same output systems, no matter the hosts' initial
    state before the deployment.

    You understand it, NixOs makes an emphasis on reproducibility. It's
    not only about building, it is about building once and forever. But
    there is more. You can version your changes and rollback them,
    duplicate a whole system (for example to balance load). You can also
    create on the fly development environments, that are as short-lived as
    a shell session. This makes Nix a strong choice for experimenting,
    installing packages to try new things without being afraid of dangling
    files if you want to remove some unwanted software.

*** Why do I use NixOS ?
    As a developer and opensource enthousiast, I self-host many of my work
    environment. I have been self-hosting for about two years. That's not
    much, but I still put countless hours in system/infrastructure
    configuration.

    In early March 2021, [[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-ovh-fire-idUSKBN2B20NU][a huge fire burnt my lovely VPS hosted at OVH,]] I
    lost many hours of work since I had only a partial backup of my
    system. I painfully understood that *building things once is great*,
    but *building things forever is better*.

    It happened in a period of my life where I was embracing Functional
    Programming and its vertues (immutability, statelessness,
    reproducibility etc) and rebuilding everything with an immutable
    declarative approach was really appealing.

    I want to capitalize on my work hours and never repeat myself so
    that I can move on building things. If I have to build my digital
    life for the next 40 years, then I would better build things in a
    both revertable and evolvable way, and never fear again a hardware
    incident.

    Some users even see NixOS as a productive environment since they
    can sync their laptop's and their fix PC's configurations so that
    their laptop system modifications when they are on the go
    can also be applied to their fix PC in a few minutes when they are
    back home.

    There are plainty of good reasons to use NixOS, and if I could not
    convince you, please be sure to check what it is worth thanks to your
    preferred search engine.

*** Credits
    I found useful resources about the installation process below. I
    gathered useful things and made it explicit for people interested in
    installing NixOS (and for my future self that hates repeating itself).

** Host system configuration
   The VPS I use is a freshly installed [[https://archlinux.org/][ArchLinux]] hosted at [[https://ovh.com/][OVH]].  When
   the VPS is freshly installed, it has the following system configuration
   (with ~cat /etc/os-release && hostnamectl~) :

   #+begin_src
   NAME="Arch Linux"
   PRETTY_NAME="Arch Linux"
   ID=arch
   BUILD_ID=rolling
   (...)
   Operating System: Arch Linux
   Kernel: Linux 5.10.11-arch1-1
   Architecture: x86-64
   #+end_src

   Note : the following manipulations are not guaranteed to work on other
   systems. This document is just my experience log with this configuration.

** Installing NixOS
*** Two strategies : ~nixos-in-place~ or ~nixos-infect~

    There are two utilities to install NixOS in place of an existing linux
    ditribution :
    - ~nixos-in-place~ is the first community script that appeared
      chronologicaly, but it is not maintained since September 2018. At
      this time, the NixOS release used was the 16.09. At time of writing,
      the latest stable release is 20.09 and contains many updates. This
      script use a file system bind and moves the pre-existing root folder ~/~
      to ~/old-root~ so that you may keep some data.

    - ~nixos-infect~ is more recent, and still under active maintenance
      but has less safeguards. It assumes that you work on a fresh system
      and does everything in place, wiping some files and folder. If you
      break your system, you can just reinstall the fresh install thanks
      to your host provider interface and start the process again.

    I will introduce both ways of doing. However, note that *I recommend
    using ~nix-infect~ !* Indeed, it is maintained and works on a more
    recent version of NixOs.

*** Installing with ~nixos-in-place~ (Not recommended)
**** Requirements

     If your VPS has important data, be sure to backup it.  This process
     will move your actual root folder ~/~ under ~/old-root~, but keep in
     mind that there may an error during the process that may corrupt your
     server and make it hard to recover your data. It is better to do this
     on a fresh server.

     The installation process requires internet, about 3Gb of RAM and 5Gb
     of free disk space.

     NOTE : the official repository relies on an old version of NixOS
     (16.09). At time of writing, the last release of NixOS is
     20.09. You can try to tweak the version yourself, but I can't
     guarantee that the script will still execute as expected.

     A more recent alternative installer is : [[https://github.com/elitak/nixos-infect][nixos-infect]]

**** On your ArchLinux VPS

     To install NixOs on a lightweight freshly installed OVH ArchLinux
     VPS, connect to it via a web shell or via ssh.

     Then, download requirements for git.
     #+begin_src shell
     pacman -Sy glibc wget squashfs-tools git
     #+end_src

     Finally, download nixos-in-place's installer, and execute it.
     (At time of writing, I am using the commit sha :
     e20ce4272fb4e3cff4d1cf90e2834e156334829a)

     #+begin_src shell
     git clone https://github.com/jeaye/nixos-in-place.git
     cd nixos-in-place
     #+end_src

     In the repository, the file ~./default-extra-config.nix~ will be copied
     into nixos host under the path ~/extra-config.nix~, and then compiled
     and set up.  You can change the default root password (~nixos~)in
     this file.

     Before launching the installation, check with ~df -h~ that a ~tmpfs~
     mount exist on the ~/tmp~ folder. In fact, the install script uses
     the /tmp folder, but this latter is too small due to the mount that
     OVH adds. Let's just unmount the tmpfs, so that the install script
     does not reach the memory space limit.
     #+begin_src shell
     umount /tmp
     #+end_src

     To launch the installation, just use :
     #+begin_src shell
     ./install
     #+end_src

     Accept all steps with ~Y~ during the process until it reboots.

**** Re-login to your brand new NixOS VPS

     ~nixos-in-place~ has wiped out your sshconfig and replaced it.
     You may or may not succeed in login through sshconfig, but let's have
     a try.

     As NixOS & nixos-in-place documentation states it, the credentials are :
     - login : root
     - Password : nixos

     Your ssh client will probably complain about changed host keys.
     You can removed remote host keys with
     #+begin_src  shell
     ssh-keygen -f $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts -R <hostname>
     #+end_src

     Now, login with ~ssh root@hostname~ and voilà !!

     If you can't login, then you will need to update your SSH
     configuration with OVH Manager's web shell (KVM - Kernel-based Virtual
     Machine).

     On, my side, I have this content under the file ~/extra-config~ on the
     remote host:
     #+begin_src nix
     services.openssh.permitRootLogin = "yes";
     users.extraUsers.root.password = "nixos";
     #+end_src

     Once you are logged in, you can verify that NixOS is installed with :
     #+begin_src shell
     cat /etc/release
     #+end_src

*** Installing with ~nixos-infect~ (Recommended)
**** Requirements
***** An SSH key for the root user
      Your VPS must be loggable with the root user through SSH without a
      password. Ensure that it is the case, otherwise, you won't be able to
      log to your VPS and will need to reinstall it and retry the whole
      process.

      Reminder : to generate an ssh key pair, you can use ~ssh-keygen -t
      rsa~, and if you already have a key pair, just ignore this command.
      You need to send your ssh public key to the root user. Explicitely,
      the content of your local ~$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub~ must be appended to
      the remote file ~/root/.ssh/authorized_keys~.
      You have to options :
      - Either do it manually via the web shell (KVM) on your OVH Manager
        interface. (To login as root : ~sudo su -~)
      - Or, send the key first to your ~arch~ user, whose the password is
        known, and copy the ssh key to the root user then (by default, on an
        OVH VPS, you can't login via SSH with the root user) :
        #+begin_src shell
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh arch@hostname 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
        ssh root@hostname sudo cat /home/arch/.ssh/authorized_keys >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
        #+end_src

**** On your ArchLinux VPS

     Before launching the installation, login to your VPS, then check
     with ~df -h~ that a ~tmpfs~ mount exist on the ~/tmp~ folder. In
     fact, the install script uses the /tmp folder, but this latter is
     too small due to the mount that OVH adds. Let's just unmount the
     tmpfs, so that the install script does not reach the memory space
     limit.
     #+begin_src shell
     umount /tmp
     #+end_src

     Ready for the installation ? Just execute :
     #+begin_src shell
     curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elitak/nixos-infect/master/nixos-infect | NIX_CHANNEL=nixos-20.09 bash -x
     #+end_src

     The VPS will reboot. Wait a few minutes. Now, you can log with
     the root user through ssh since your SSH keys have been
     conserved.
**** Re-login to your brand new NixOS VPS
     Your ssh client will probably complain about changed host keys.
     You can removed remote host keys with
     #+begin_src  shell
     ssh-keygen -f $HOME/.ssh/known_hosts -R hostname
     #+end_src

     Now, login with ~ssh root@hostname~ and voilà !!

** Display a neofetch screen
   Once logged in. Update the channels (repositories) with
   ~nix-channel --update~.

   If you try to run ~neofetch~, it won't find the package.
   Actually, we dont want neofetch on our system. We just want to
   execute it once and clean everything after.

   Thus, let's create a short-lived shell session, install `neofetch`
   only for that session, run neofetch et clean everything up as if we
   had done nothing !
   #+begin_src shell
   nix-shell --package neofetch --run neofetch && nix-collect-garbage
   #+end_src

   You see ! Very simple ! And if you run `neofetch` again, it can't
   be found as if it had never been installed. Welcome on NixOS !

** Conclusion
   I wanted a NixOS VPS hosted at OVH but this cloud provider does not
   offer NixOS installations. No problem, thanks to the awesome Nix
   community, we managed to install NixOS on an ArchLinux VPS. The
   workflow can still be enhanced, by deploying your pre-existing nix
   configuration files before running ~nix-infect~ for example.

   I hope you liked this article, I would like to write more about
   NixOS as soon as I play with it a bit more ! Be sure to follow me
   on social media or to subscribe to my RSS feed if you want to see
   more of my content.
