#+TITLE: Hey, I am Lydéric

Hello world !

I'm *Lydéric Dutillieux*, I'm 22 years old at time of writing, and I'm
passionate about technology, business, investment, personnal
development and science.

There are many things I would like to achieve in my life, and I guess
that starting with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRE_movement][FIRE (Financial Independance, Retire Early)]] would
allow me to work full time on solving most of the world's biggest
problems, regardless of my time's ROI.

For now, I'm mainly earning a living as a *Freelance Software Engineer*,
with [[https://www.origenial.fr/][Origénial]] and investing most of my time in developping a
platform, called [[https://www.ponceleo.com/][Ponceleo]], that aims at *expanding the lifespan of people's goods*
and *fighting against planned obsolescence*.
