*Imagine a world where* targeted advertisements would not exist and
instead *we would be surrounded by targeted educational contents*.

Instead of feeding people with garbage ads they don't need, people
would be fed with *targeted knowledge they need* and more than that,
with *knowledge they couldn't find by themselves*. How many
opportunities have been lost because someone did not have the right
information at the right time ?

How would society evolve if, instead of softening brains, targeted
 *advertisements engines would be reprogrammed and would sprinkle
empowering thoughts, freeing extraordinary minds.*

People would understand *the richness of multiculturality*, *the urge
of acting against climate change*, and more generally, *the wisdom
behind open knowledge* regarding the most challenging problems of our
era.

In a nutshell : *Less mind-numbing ads, more empowering knowledge*
