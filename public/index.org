Hi, welcome on my blog !

I'm Lydéric Dutillieux, I'm 25 years old at time of writing, and I'm
passionate about technology, business, investment, personal
development and science.

I'm a problem solver, and I work as an IT Consultant at [[https://www.origenial.fr/][Origénial]], my own modest Consultancy.

Sharing ideas gives many collective opportunities, and I'm fearly convinced that [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1THE-vyhk4A]["Apes together strong"]].
So, enjoy the ride on this blog and feel free to reach out one way or another.

/PS 1/ : The first release of this blog has been made on the 31st January 2021,
when I was 22 and freshly out of school. The blog is now inactive, but I thought I'd keep it, cause it's cheap and some
articles are referenced on internet already and I don't want to break the links.
