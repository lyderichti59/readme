* How to contribute

** Setup
*** Installing Jekyll and dependencies (macOs)

  Jekyll is deployed with the 'jekyll-org' plugin, which only works with Ruby 2.x unfortunately.

  Below steps are extracted from : https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/
  - Install a ruby environment manager : ~brew install chruby ruby-install xz~
  - Install the version of ruby supported by this website : ~ruby-install ruby 2.7.4~
  - Setup your zsh shell

  ```
  echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
  echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

  - Check that it works on a new shell with : ~chruby ruby-2.4.7 && ruby -v
  - Install Bundler with `gem` : ~gem install bundler~

*** Initialising the repository for the first time
  - ~bundle init
  - Bundle dependencies in a local project :  ~bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'~
  - ~bundle add jekyll~
  - ~bundle exec jekyll new --force --skip-bundle .~ to init the Jekyll folder
  - ~bundle install~

** Operate
   - To serve a dev server, once sucessfully setup, try : ~bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload --incremental~
   - As Github Pages do not support the ~jekyll-org~ plugin, .org files are not rendered with the github pages builder.
     Consequently, the website must be deployed manually. Build the ouptut ~_site~ folder with the following command:
     ~JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build~ and upload the file to Netlify
